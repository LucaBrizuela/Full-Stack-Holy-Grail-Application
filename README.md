# Full-Stack-Holy-Grail-Application
This project builds on the foundation of the Holy Grail layout application by adding a full stack element with a Redis database layer, allowing for dynamic and efficient data management. The application combines a front-end interface with an Express API, which now connects to a Redis database for real-time data storage and updates.
